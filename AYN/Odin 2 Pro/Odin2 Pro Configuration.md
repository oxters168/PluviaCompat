# Odin 2 Pro Configuration Guide

## Performance Modes
- Switch to **High Performance Mode** for the best performance. This offers benefits over the "Performance" mode, but does rung the CPU harder/hotter. CPU performance only has an indirect relationship with the emulated performance, but it does significantly improve loading tiems.
- Find the "Performance" button in the Android quick menu by swiping down from the top of the screen, and set it to the desired mode.

## Fan Mode
- From the same quick menu, set the fan speed to **Smart** or **Sport**. If the fan is in "Quiet" mode, it will impact actual game perfromance.

## Joystick Sensitivity
- Adjust joystick sensitivity for better control.
- Go to Android settings > Odin Settings > Controller Settings > Joystick Calibration & Gamepad Test.

## Graphics Settings
- Use the **Turnip(Adreno)** Graphics Driver setting for better graphics performance.
- The Odin 2 Pro has great support with the Turnip drivers, and testing has shown its stability.

## Mouse Mode
- Enable **Mouse Mode** for the joysticks from the Android Settings app.
- Set a macro/hotkey for enabling **Mouse Mode**. Mainy people map it to the two back buttons held at once.
- This allows you to use the joysticks as a mouse for easier navigation in the case that the touch screen becomes unresponsive, or if you need a high level of accuracy than you could with your finger or a stylus.

Enjoy your gaming! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
